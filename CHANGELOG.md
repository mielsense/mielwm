# Changelog

What changed in the mielwm app, newest version first. Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). While mielwm is below 1.0, a new minor version can change how things work.

## Unreleased

### Fixes

- Leaving macOS full screen, like a full screen video, no longer flashes two desktops side by side. mielwm leaves a full screen window alone and keeps its tile for when it comes back.
- Closing, minimizing or hiding the focused window keeps you on the same workspace. The most recent window on screen takes focus.
- An app that resizes its own window, like an Electron app restoring its size, no longer shifts the split between tiles. Only dragging an edge does.
- With displays of different widths, showing a workspace on one display no longer shows part of the workspace before it on another. Workspaces move further apart when a wider display is plugged in.
- A window from another workspace that its app keeps putting back on screen is tucked away again after a short wait, instead of staying over the workspace you're on.
- A tiled window snaps back to its tile each time you drag it away, not only the first two times.

## 0.1.0

Released October 27, 2026. The first release.

### Workspaces and layouts

- Workspaces 1 to 9 sit side by side on one endless canvas. `⌥1` to `⌥9` go to one, and `⌥⇧1` to `⌥⇧9` move the focused window there.
- Each workspace tiles its windows, stacks them at full size, or lets a window float where you put it.
- Gaps of 8 points between windows and 12 around the edge by default, like AeroSpace, with a separate top gap for displays other than the built-in one.
- Workspace rules send an app's windows to a fixed workspace, and floating apps always float.
- Fill, fullscreen and pin for the focused window, plus grow, shrink and swapping tiles.
- Works across several displays. The workspace you go to opens on the display under the pointer.

### The overview

- `⌃⌥G` zooms out to every window as a live picture, through a curved lens that bends the edges of the canvas.
- Type to search window titles and app names, then `Return` to go or `⇧Return` to bring the window to you.
- Pan, zoom, frame a window, tidy floating windows onto a grid, and undo or redo moves.
- A minimap of the whole canvas, and a sheet listing every key with `⌘/`.

### Keyboard, trackpad and mouse

- AeroSpace's default keys wherever AeroSpace has the same action.
- `⌥Tab` goes back to the last window, or shows a recent-windows switcher while you hold `⌥`.
- Three-finger swipes switch workspaces, with a click you can feel on Force Touch trackpads.
- `⌃⌥` with a drag moves or resizes any window, and a middle-button drag pans the canvas.

### Settings and the menu bar

- A Settings window with General, Layout & workspaces, Keyboard, Appearance and Advanced panes.
- A shortcut recorder that catches conflicts with other actions and with macOS's own shortcuts.
- A live preview of the overview on the Appearance pane, with accent colors, lens strength, background and grid.
- The menu bar shows which workspaces have windows. Pause hands every window back to macOS until you resume.
- Every setting lives in `~/.config/mielwm/config.json`, which reloads as soon as you save it and lists its errors in the menu.

### AeroSpace and Barik

- Import from AeroSpace reads your gaps, layout, rules and key bindings. The first launch imports the gaps, layout and rules on its own.
- mielwm notices a running AeroSpace and offers to quit it.
- Work with Barik lets Barik's menu bar show mielwm's workspaces, with no change to Barik.

### Windows stay safe

- Quitting, pausing or logging out puts every window back on a screen. After a crash, a small watcher does the same.
- Windows come back to their places on the canvas after a restart.
- `mielwm --unpark` brings every window back by hand, if all else fails.

### Install and performance

- A signed DMG. Every release is signed with the same identity, so macOS keeps your permissions across updates.
- The `mielwm` command controls the running app from a terminal or a script.
- About 0.01% of one CPU core and 90 MB of memory at rest.
